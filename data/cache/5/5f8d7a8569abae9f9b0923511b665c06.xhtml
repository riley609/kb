<strong>Create the Boot Disk:</strong>
You’ll need to create a boot disk using another PC. Download from here:

Resetting Your Windows Password
Boot your PC from the boot disk (you might have to adjust the BIOS to allow booting from the CD). You’ll be prompted at a couple of screens, which you can generally just hit the Enter key at. For instance, this screen asks if you want to select the first partition, and [1] is already selected, so just hit Enter.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The same thing happens at the next step, where you have to choose the path to your registry. The default is fine, so hit Enter.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/kb/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:image_2.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Next you can choose whether to use password reset or some other thing, so just hit Enter for password reset.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Next you’ll be prompted whether you want to edit users or the registry. You want to edit user passwords, so hit Enter again.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/kb/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:image_4.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
And now, the first screen where you’ll need to do something other than hit the Enter key. In this case, you’ll want to type the username that you want to reset. In my case, this was “geek”, so I just typed that (without the quotes). Then hit Enter.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/kb/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:image_5.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
Now you’ll want to probably just blank the password, which is already selected, so hit the Enter key again (you can always change it once you’re back in Windows).
</p>

<p>
<img src="/kb/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:image_6.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
And now, you’ll have to save what you just did. So type an exclamation point to quit (or the “!” symbol), then type the letter “y” to save.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/kb/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:image_7.png" class="media" alt="" />
</p>

<p>
At this point it should say “EDIT COMPLETE”, and you can reboot your computer. You should be able to login without any problems—just make sure to go set a new password.
