 instructions that will resolve both the missing icons and the ugly theme issues:
Install the following packages: gtk3-engines-unico gtk2-engines-murrine gtk2-engines-pixbuf humanity-icon-theme
Download the http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Zukitwo?content=140562"]Zukitwo theme[/url] from gnome-look.org.
Follow the included instructions to install it (installing to ~/.themes works fine).
Create the file /home/username/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini (replacing "username" with your login name) with the following contents:
Code:
[Settings]
gtk-theme-name = Zukitwo
gtk-fallback-icon-theme = Humanity
# next option is applicable only if selected theme supports it
gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme = false
# set font name and dimension
gtk-font-name = Ubuntu 9
[/list]
These changes will affect all GTK3 apps, not just Evolution.

Now, to address the gnome-keyring issue: The problem is that the gnome-keyring is not being logged into when the user logs into the desktop session. Here is what I did to solve this:
[list][*]Install the following packages: gnome-keyring libpam-gnome-keyring seahorse[*]Add the following two lines to /etc/pam.d/kdm:
Code:
auth    optional   pam_gnome_keyring.so try_first_pass
session  optional   pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start
...but they must be added in the correct spot, so the resultant file should look like this:
Code:
#
# /etc/pam.d/kdm - specify the PAM behaviour of kdm
#
auth    required   pam_nologin.so
auth    required   pam_env.so readenv=1
auth    required   pam_env.so readenv=1 envfile=/etc/default/locale
@include common-auth
auth    optional   pam_gnome_keyring.so try_first_pass
session  required   pam_limits.so
@include common-account
@include common-password
@include common-session
session  optional   pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start
[*]Add the following line to the end of /etc/pam.d/passwd:
Code:
password  optional  pam_gnome_keyring.so
Run seahorse and delete the default keyring and create a new keyring called “login” with a password identical to your login password. Set this as default.
Reboot and cross your fingers, legs, etc. and hope it works. If all went well, you shouldn't be prompted to enter your keyring password.
