**Restrictive apache2 configuration (linux)**//

You can face some issues if AllowOverride is disabled and/or FollowSymLinks option is off in your main configuration. To overcome this, create a file named gitlist.conf inside the /etc/apache2/conf.d/ folder with this content :

   Alias /gitlist /srv/www/htdocs/gitlist/
   <Directory /srv/www/htdocs/gitlist>
      Options FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride All
   </Directory>


/srv/www/htdocs/ is the default htdocs path on some GNU/Linux setups, you must change it to the actual htdocs base path if it is different.

Note: With Apache 2.4, the default configuration folder has changed from /etc/apache2/conf.d to /etc/apache2/conf-available. So if you're using Apache 2.4, you need to put the aforementioned gitlist.conf into /etc/apache2/conf-available. Then you need to activate it (symlink it from 'conf-available' to 'conf-enabled') with

     a2enconf gitlist
     
and restart Apache.
