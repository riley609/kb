**Step 3: Configuring LMD**

By default all options are fully commented in the configuration file, so configure it according to your needs. But before making any changes let’s have a detailed review of each option below.

   email_alert : If you would like to receive email alerts, then it should be set to 1.
   email_subj : Set your email subject here.
   email_addr : Add your email address to receive malware alerts.
   quar_hits : The default quarantine action for malware hits, it should be set 1.
   quar_clean : Cleaing detected malware injections, must set to 1.
   quar_susp : The default suspend action for users wih hits.
   quar_susp_minuid : Minimum userid that can be suspended.
   
Open file /usr/local/maldetect/conf.maldet and make changes according to your needs.
   # vi /usr/local/maldetect/conf.maldet

Sample Configuration
Here is the my sample configuration file.
# [ EMAIL ALERTS ]
##
# The default email alert toggle
# [0 = disabled, 1 = enabled]
email_alert=1

# The subject line for email alerts
email_subj="maldet alert from $(hostname)"

# The destination addresses for email alerts
# [ values are comma (,) spaced ]
email_addr="tecmint.com@gmail.com"

# Ignore e-mail alerts for reports in which all hits have been cleaned.
# This is ideal on very busy servers where cleaned hits can drown out
# other more actionable reports.
email_ignore_clean=0

##
# [ QUARANTINE OPTIONS ]
##
# The default quarantine action for malware hits
# [0 = alert only, 1 = move to quarantine & alert]
quar_hits=1

# Try to clean string based malware injections
# [NOTE: quar_hits=1 required]
# [0 = disabled, 1 = clean]
quar_clean=1

# The default suspend action for users wih hits
# Cpanel suspend or set shell /bin/false on non-Cpanel
# [NOTE: quar_hits=1 required]
# [0 = disabled, 1 = suspend account]
quar_susp=0
# minimum userid that can be suspended
quar_susp_minuid=500


**Step 4: Manual Scans and Usage**
-----------------------------------

If you would like to scan user’s Home directory, then simply issue following command.

    # maldet --scan-all /home
    
You performed a scan but failed to turn on the quarantine option, don’t worry just use the following command to turn on and quarantine all previous malware scan results.

   #maldet --quarantine SCANID
   
   OR
   # maldet --clean SCANID
   
**Step 5: Daily Scans**
---------------------

By default installation keeps LMD script under /etc/cron.daily/maldet and it is used to perform a daily scans, update of signatures, quarantine etc, and sends a daily report of malware scan to your specified emails. If you need to add additional paths to be scanned, then you should edit this file accordingly to your requirements.
   # vi /etc/cron.daily/maldet
