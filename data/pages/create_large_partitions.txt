====== Using parted to create large partitions ======

To create partitions larger than 2TB, fdisk cannot be used as the disk has to be set up with GPT.

If our disk is /dev/sdd, then:

===== Start parted and configure partition type =====

  parted /dev/sdd
  mklabel gpt

===== Partition Whole disk =====

  mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
  quit  

===== Format disk =====

  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdd1
