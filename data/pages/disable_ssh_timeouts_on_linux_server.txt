====== Disable SSH timeouts ======
--------------------

To pretty much completely disable SSH timeouts, simply adjust the following directives in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

  TCPKeepAlive yes
  ClientAliveInterval 30
  ClientAliveCountMax 99999
  
  
//EDIT: Once that’s changed, be sure to restart your ssh daemon.//

Additionally on your side and restart ssh afterwards:
-------------------------

  Edit /etc/ssh/ssh_config
  
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  
**SECURITY WARNING: If you remove users from your system, but they’re still connected via ssh, their connection may remain open indefinitely. Be sure to check all active ssh sessions after adjusting a user’s access.**
