====== Generate a CSR with OpenSSL ======


**__Prerequisites__**
What you'll need first is to install Openssl on your server, this is a common package and will be available on all of the major distros through their package installer. Here is how you check to see if it is installed in a "Yum" style system:

    # rpm -qa | grep -i openssl
The above command should return the following packages, or something similar:

openssl-0.9.8e-7.el5 openssl-0.9.8e-7.el5 openssl-devel-0.9.8e-7.el5

If it didn't you'll want to run the following:

    # yum install openssl openssl-devel

__**Generate the RSA key**__
Create a RSA key for your Apache server, since every distro is different in where to place the certificates, we are just going to place it in an arbitrary spot:

    # mkdir ~/domain.com.ssl/
    # cd ~/domain.com.ssl/

Type the following command to generate a private key.

    # openssl genrsa -out ~/domain.com.ssl/domain.com.key 2048

__**Create a CSR**__
Type the following command to create a CSR with the RSA private key (output will be PEM format):

    # openssl req -new -sha256 -key ~/domain.com.ssl/domain.com.key -out ~/domain.com.ssl/domain.com.csr
When creating a CSR you must follow these conventions. Enter the information to be displayed in the certificate. The following characters can not be used for the Organization Name or the Organizational Unit: < > ~ ! @ # $ % ^ * / \ ( ) ?.,&

**Warning: Leave the challenge password blank (press enter)****Bold Text**

__**Verify your CSR**__
    # openssl req -noout -text -in ~/domain.com.ssl/domain.com.csr

__**Submit your CSR**__
From this point you have to take your CSR that you created here and submit it to a certificate authority.
