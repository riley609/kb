====== Screen – Linux Administrator’s Best Friend ======

Screen is a utility provided by GNU and usually comes pre-installed in most of the distros. If not, then using the package manager for your respective distros, you can install screen.

Like for Fedora/centos/redhat:

  $ sudo yum install screen -y

For ubuntu based systems:

  $ sudo apt-get install screen -y

 

**Info: The key bindings given in this tutorial are all case sensitive, so Ctrl+c is not equal to Ctrl+C**

**Creating screen sessions:**
First time you need a start a screen session, which can be done easily by using the command screen.

  $ screen

If you want to give your screen session a name, so that you could identify it later, then you need to create a session like this:

  $ screen -S napster

Once you have created one instance of screen, you can have multiple sessions inside that screen instance, or you can say in other words, multiple tabs.

  To create more session, use “Ctlr+a” followed by “c“.

To check what screen session you are running, use this command:

  $ screen -ls

Output:
   There is a screen on:
  8762.napster (Detached)
  1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-napster.
  Detaching and Attaching:
  To detach from an attached screen, use “Ctrl+a” followed by “d“.

Now, from the next time you just need to come and re-attach to your previous screen session like this

  $ screen -d -r napster
  -d = detach from any previous session
  -r = reattach to this session
If there are more than one screen session running, and you haven’t given them names, then use the pid of the screen session to attach to that specific screen.

  $ screen -r pid

If you want to attach to a screen, which is already attached to someone else’s window, and you don’t want others to be disconnected, use “-x” instead of “-r“

  $ screen -x screen_name/pid

By default all the sessions will be with named “bash”, though you can rename them according to your comfort, with “Ctrl+a” followed by “A“.

When you have more than one session, you can switch between them using these shortcuts:

  “Ctrl+a” followed by “n”  –> next session

  “Ctrl+a” followed by “p”  –> previous session

====== GNU Screen – Advanced Tutorial ======


ScreenShots:
Instead of using the OS utility for taking screenshots, you can use the screen feature to take the snapshot of the current text in the window. Use “Ctrl+a” followed by “h“, will have a text file in your home directory with the name “hardcopy.n“, which will contain all the text from the console.

Logging:
The best thing what I like about screen is that you can have logs of anything you have done on screen, which can be used in lot of things in future. To enable logging, use “Ctrl+a” followed by “H“. This will create a file with name “screenlog.0” in your home directory, which will contain anything or everything you have done on the screen. If you want to stop logging, use the same, “Ctrl+a” & “H“.

You can also enable logging while starting your screen session, which can be done by using “-L” switch:

  $ screen -L -S napster
  
Split Screen:
If you are really geeky (or you want to show that you are geeky :) ), then screen split is something you must be using. With that you can have move than one screens in just one display.

You can split your terminal windows horizontally and vertically (for vertical split, you need to patch your screen).

  To Split the screen horizontally: Ctrl+a & S

  To split the screen vertically: Ctrl+a & |

  To switch between windows: Ctrl+a & Tab

  To kill your current window: Ctrl+a & X

**Sharing:**
There are scenarios when different people login to a machine with different usernames and you would like to share your screen session with all of them, which normally is not possible as one user can’t attach to a screen of other user. To achieve this, you need to do some tweaking.

First, setuid root on screen binary.

  $ sudo chmod +s `which screen`
  
Then create a  screen session:

  $ screen -S napster
Turn multiuser mode “on” in the screen session:

  Ctrl+q then :multiuser on

Then give permission to other users to attach to the screen

  Ctrl+a -> :acladd student

Then ask them to attach to the screen

$ screen -x username/session
Sometimes you want others to watch and not to interfere, for that you need to make them read-only.

  Ctrl+a -> :aclchg student -w “#”

This will make student as read-only, and student won’t be able to write anything in the screen.

To write something on the screen wall so that everyone could look at that:

  Ctrl+a -> :aclchg student -w “#”
