====== How to Shut Down a Virtual Machine which is Unresponsive in the Pending or Amber State ======

===== Objective =====

This article describes how to shut down a virtual machine, which is in a pending state (or amber state), from the %%XenServer%% control domain.

Sometimes, when you initiate a shutdown or a reboot from the %%XenCenter%%, the virtual machine is in an unresponsive state when it is in the pending state (or amber state), and the task being performed is also in unresponsive state.

The **xe-toolstack-restart ** refreshes all tasks and displays the virtual machine to be in a running state, but the virtual machine would not be available or be responding.

Basically the process (dom-id) associated with the virtual machine is unresponsive in the %%XenServer%% control domain. The only method to recover is to terminate the dom-id for the virtual machine or reboot the %%XenServer%%.

===== Instructions =====

You require the following components:

  * Console session to the %%XenServer%% control domain

  * Intermediate Linux / %%XenServer%% administration skills

To shut down a virtual machine, which is in an amber state from %%XenServer%% control domain, complete the following procedure:

=== Get the UUID ===
  * Select the virtual machine in %%XenCenter%% and check the general tab to obtain the UUID of the virtual machine, which is in an unresponsive state:\\

=== Check UUID ===
  * Run the following command to check the dom-id of the virtual machine in the %%XenServer%% control domain: 

  list_domains | grep <UUID from step1> 

  * Following is a sample of the preceding command: 

  [root@Xen6 ~]# list_domains | grep bcdb1445-1f28-9600-ae84-53c254167ae6  
  Output : 51 | bcdb1445-1f28-9600-ae84-53c254167ae6 | H 
  
**51** – the dom-id of the VM \\ 
**bcdb1445-1f28-9600-ae84-53c254167ae6** – UUID of the VM \\ 
**H** – state of the virtual machine (H indicates that this is a HVM guest, typically it means this is a Windows virtual machine.) \\ 
\\

=== Destroy the Session for that Domain ID ===
  * Run the following command to destroy the dom-id of the virtual machine: \\ 

  /opt/xensource/debug/xenops destroy_domain –domid <ID from step2>

  * Following is a sample of the preceding command: \\ 

  opt/xensource/debug/xenops destroy_domain –domid 51
