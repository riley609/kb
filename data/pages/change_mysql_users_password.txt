====== Change Mysql root Password ======


**Changing Password with mysqladmin command:**

mysqladmin command is one way to interact with the information stored in user table from OS command line interface. If you have done a fresh installation of Mysql, then there is no password set for root user. To set a new password for the same, use this command:

  $ mysqladmin -u root password NEWPASSWORD
  
This will create the password for the root user.

Also, to change the password of root user, one needs to use the command like this:

  $ mysqladmin -u root -p'oldpassword' password 'NEWPASSWORD'
  
If you don’t provide any old password with “-p”, then it will prompt you for a pasword after executing this command.

**To change the password of normal user, same procedure is followed:**

  $ mysqladmin -u myuser -p'oldpassword' password 'NEWPASSWORD'
  
**Changing password with Mysql sql command:**

You can also update the information in the user table with the sql command. Following steps needs to be followed for the same.

**Login to Mysql server**

  $ mysql -u root -p'password'
  
Go to mysql database

  mysql> use mysql;

Change password for test user

  mysql> update user set password=PASSWORD("NEWPASSWORD") where user="test";

Now reload the privileges, which will update the cache and flush the old password

  mysql> flush privileges;

  mysql> ctrl+D

====== Reset a lost root MySQL user password: ======
 

**Stop Mysql Server:**

  $ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
  
Then, start the mysql server with skip-grant-tables options. –skip-grant-tables option will force the mysql process not to read the user table into memory, so that when you try to login to the Mysql server, it won’t ask for the password.

  $ sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables  &
  
This command is very dangerous if you Mysql server is connected to the network. While you are recovering your password, someone can login to your server remotely and do whatever he/she wants. To keep that safe, start your server with “–skip-networking” option, which will not open a network port for the server

  $ mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
Now connect to mysql server using mysql client without giving any password

  $ mysql -u root -p
  
Now setup the new password for the root user:

  mysql> use mysql;

  mysql> update user set password=PASSWORD("NEWPASSWORD") where user="root";

  mysql> flush privileges;

  mysql> Ctrl+D
  
Now stop the mysql server

  $ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
  
Now start the mysql server normally, so that it could read the password information.

  $ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
