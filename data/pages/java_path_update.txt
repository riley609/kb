====== Set JAVA_HOME / PATH for a single user ======



//Login to your account and open .bash_profile file//
$ vi ~/.bash_profile

Set JAVA_HOME as follows using syntax export JAVA_HOME=<path-to-java>. 

//If your path is set to /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin/java, set it as follows://
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin/java

//Set PATH as follows://
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin

Feel free to replace /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07 as per your setup. Save and close the file. Just logout and login back to see new changes. Alternatively, type the following command to activate the new path settings immediately:

   $ source ~/.bash_profile

OR

   $  . ~/.bash_profile

//Verify new settings://
   $ echo $JAVA_HOME
   $ echo $PATH
